# Blockchain-Based Will Executor

## Project Description

The Blockchain-Based Will Executor is a revolutionary smart contract system that brings transparency, security, and automation to estate planning and will execution. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this decentralized solution eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries while ensuring immutable record-keeping and automated asset distribution according to the testator's wishes.

The system leverages blockchain technology to create tamper-proof wills that can be executed automatically when predetermined conditions are met, reducing disputes, delays, and costs associated with traditional probate processes.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize estate planning by creating a trustless, transparent, and efficient system for will creation and execution. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Trust Issues**: Remove the need to rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries
- **Reduce Costs**: Minimize legal fees and administrative expenses through automation
- **Prevent Disputes**: Provide immutable, transparent records that reduce family conflicts
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Make estate planning accessible to people worldwide, regardless of their location or economic status
- **Guarantee Execution**: Automate the distribution process to ensure the testator's wishes are carried out precisely

## Key Features

### üîí **Immutable Will Creation**
- Create tamper-proof wills stored permanently on the blockchain
- Timestamped records with cryptographic security
- Support for multiple asset types and beneficiaries

### üë• **Multi-Beneficiary Support**
- Add unlimited beneficiaries with specific allocation percentages
- Detailed asset descriptions for each beneficiary
- Automatic validation to ensure allocations don't exceed 100%

### ‚ö° **Automated Execution**
- Smart contract-based execution when conditions are met
- Automatic fund distribution to beneficiaries
- Real-time tracking of execution status

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Authorization**
- Role-based access control for executors
- Only testators can modify their wills before execution
- Multiple security modifiers to prevent unauthorized access

### üìä **Transparency & Tracking**
- Complete audit trail of all will activities
- Public verification of will authenticity
- Real-time status updates for all stakeholders

### üí∞ **Cost-Effective**
- Minimal gas fees compared to traditional legal processes
- No ongoing administrative costs
- Direct peer-to-peer asset transfer

### üîß **Flexible Management**
- Ability to activate/deactivate wills
- Add or modify beneficiaries before execution
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms for contract owner

## Smart Contract Core Functions

### 1. `createWill(string _testatorName, string _executionConditions)`
Creates a new will with the testator's details and execution conditions. The function accepts ETH deposits that will be distributed to beneficiaries upon execution.

### 2. `addBeneficiary(uint256 _willId, address _beneficiaryAddress, string _beneficiaryName, uint256 _allocationPercentage, string _assetDescription)`
Adds beneficiaries to an existing will with specific allocation percentages and asset descriptions. Includes validation to ensure total allocations don't exceed 100%.

### 3. `executeWill(uint256 _willId)`
Executes a will and automatically distributes funds to all designated beneficiaries based on their allocation percentages. Can only be called by authorized executors.
